{"name":"Harmesy","tagline":"","body":"Hey all. A quick introduction is in order I suppose.\r\n\r\nMy name is Matt Harmes. I am a recent graduate of the [Schulich School of Law](http://dal.ca/law) at [Dalhousie University](http://dal.ca). Before that I graduated from [Saint Francis Xavier University](http://stfx.ca) with my Bachelor of Information Systems. I did a 16 month internship with IBM at their software lab in Toronto as a Java Developer in the MDM team. Between StFX and law school I spent time living and travelling in New Zealand, and working in the southern Ontario region.\r\n\r\nAs for what this site will be, that remains to be seen. I'll probably use this for going over articles or issues I find particularly interesting. This could be anything from technology to politics, from sports to current issues. I don't expect to be publishing very often, as my plan is to go more for quality over quantity.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately that's all I have for the moment. Thanks for reading.","google":"UA-40964521-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
