title: Electronic Signatures and Separation Agreements
---
Electronic communication seems to become more and more pervasive in our personal lives by each passing day. We are now accustomed to purchasing goods and services online, searching and applying for jobs online, dating online, and perhaps we can start separating online.

In Ontario, separation agreements, and all other "domestic contracts" are provided for by the [Family Law Act](http://canlii.ca/t/2d8). Pursuant to [section 55](http://canlii.ca/t/529dh#sec55subsec1) all domestic contracts (or agreements to amend or rescind) are unenforceable unless made in writing, signed by the parties, and witnessed.

The reference to the "in writing" requirement would lead one to believe that it is necessary to have a physical hard copy of the agreement, which is signed in ink by the hand of all parties and witnesses. In practice, this is in fact what generally occurs, as copies of the final agreement are couriered back and forth, sometimes along with handwritten modifications and the necessary initials.

However, there may in fact be another option. The [Electronic Commerce Act](http://canlii.ca/t/1k84) ("ECA") is designed to enable greater use of electronic signatures and electronic documents in a variety of contexts. The ECA is based on the UN Model Law on Electronic Commerce, which was adopted in the *Uniform Electronic Commerce Act* ("UECA") by the Uniform Law Conference of Canada. The preamble sets out the reasoning for such an act nicely:
> Legal relationships have long been based on paper documentation. Many rules of law are expressed in language that suits documents on paper. Over the past generation, however, paper has been giving way to computer-generated communications. In the past decade, networked computers and particularly the Internet have accelerated the replacement of paper and spread it into new domains, notably to consumer and domestic transactions.
All provinces have now enacted legislation based on the UECA.

[Section 5](http://canlii.ca/t/1k84#sec5) of the ECA states the following:
>Legal requirement that information or document be in writing

>5.  A legal requirement that information or a document be in writing is satisfied by information or a document that is in electronic form if it is accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference. 2000, c. 17, s. 5.

Further, [section 11](http://canlii.ca/t/1k84#sec11) sets out the following:
>Legal requirement that document be signed

>11.  (1)  Subject to subsections (3) and (4), a legal requirement that a document be signed is satisfied by an electronic signature. 2000, c. 17, s. 11 (1).

>Endorsement

>(2)  For greater certainty, subsection (1) also applies to a legal requirement that a document be endorsed. 2000, c. 17, s. 11 (2).

>Reliability requirements

>(3)  If the document is prescribed for the purposes of this subsection or belongs to a class prescribed for those purposes, the legal requirement is satisfied only if in light of all the circumstances, including any relevant agreement, the purpose for which the document is created and the time the electronic signature is made,

>(a) the electronic signature is reliable for the purpose of identifying the person; and

>(b) the association of the electronic signature with the relevant electronic document is reliable. 2000, c. 17, s. 11 (3).

>Other requirements

>(4)  If the document is prescribed for the purposes of this subsection or belongs to a class prescribed for those purposes, the legal requirement is satisfied only if,

>(a) the electronic signature meets the prescribed requirements, if any, as to method; and

>(b) the electronic signature meets the prescribed information technology standards, if any. 2000, c. 17, s. 11 (4).

The ECA itself does not override legislation that explicitly prohibits the use of electronic documents. [Section 26](http://canlii.ca/t/1k84#sec26) sets out just that as follows:
>Preservation of other laws re electronic documents

>26.  (1)  Nothing in this Act limits the operation of any provision of law that expressly authorizes, prohibits or regulates the use of electronic information or electronic documents. 2000, c. 17, s. 26 (1).

>Other requirements continue to apply

>(2)  Nothing in this Act limits the operation of a legal requirement for information to be posted or displayed in a specified manner or for any information or document to be transmitted by a specified method. 2000, c. 17, s. 26 (2).

>References to writing or signing

>(3)  A reference to writing or signing does not in itself constitute a prohibition for the purpose of subsection (1) or a legal requirement for the purpose of subsection (2). 2000, c. 17, s. 26 (3).

There are enumerated documents to which the ECA does not apply. They are set out in [section 31](http://canlii.ca/t/1k84#sec31subsec1):
>Documents to which Act does not apply

>31.  (1)  This Act does not apply to the following documents:

>>1. Wills and codicils.

>>2. Trusts created by wills or codicils.

>>3. Powers of attorney, to the extent that they are in respect of an individualâ€™s financial affairs or personal care.

>>4. Documents, including agreements of purchase and sale, that create or transfer interests in land and require registration to be effective against third parties.

>>Note: On a day to be named by proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor, paragraph 4 is repealed. (See: 2013, c. 2, Sched. 5, ss. 2, 3)

>>5. Negotiable instruments.

>>6. Documents that are prescribed or belong to a prescribed class. 2000, c. 17, s. 31 (1).

Pursuant to section 55 of the Family Law Act, all domestic contracts must be in writing, witnessed, and signed. The Electronic Commerce Act permits the requirement of in writing, and signing to be satisfied by electronic means. The Family Law Act contains no language which specifically excludes electronic documents or signatures, and the Electronic Commerce Act does not specifically exclude domestic contracts.

While I could not locate caselaw on the foregoing, on a reading of the legislation it seems that an electronic domestic contract would meet the basic requirements of a domestic contact as set out by section 55 of the Family Law Act.
