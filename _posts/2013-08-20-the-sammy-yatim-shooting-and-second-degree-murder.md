title: The Sammy Yatim shooting and Second Degree Murder
---

For those of you who may not be from Canada, or may not be familiar with the July 27th shooting here's a quick background. Mr. Yatim was an 18-year-old man who inexplicably pulled a knife on a streetcar in downtown Toronto. Passengers, and eventually the streetcar driver, fled the vehicle, leaving Mr. Yatim alone inside. Toronto Police responded to the call, and officers ended up positioned outside the front passenger-side door, with Mr. Yatim positioned just inside the door. At some point during the confrontation a police officer, Constable James Forcillo, opened fire on Mr. Yatim. Ultimately nine shots were fired, with an initial volley of three followed after a brief pause by the final six in rapid succession.

Much (but not all) of the incident was captured on video by witnesses who had happened upon the scene. The videos quickly found themselves on sites such as youtube, and the public has largely responded with anger and frustration, given that Mr. Yatim appeared to be alone on the car.

I'm not going to debate the decision to open fire right here. That will be handled in the court of law where all the relevant evidence will be properly presented. At this point any talk about the justification of the shooting would be pure speculation.

The one thing I am going to talk about is the laying of charges that occurred today. Constable Forcillo has now been charged with Second degree murder by the SIU, an independent group that takes over investigations where there has been serious injury or death involving police.

The laying of a charge of Second degree Murder is a big deal. Especially in a case such as this one. This is only [the third time](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2013/08/19/toronto-police-shooting-yatim-officer-charged.html) that the SIU have laid second degree murder charges against a peace officer for actions taken while on duty, and as far as I know none have been convicted.

Because of this, some have questioned the wisdom of laying the second degree murder charge, and believe that manslaughter would have been the correct path to take. I think it would be helpful for the general public to have a quick refresher as to how this stage in the process works, and what exactly the differences are under the Canadian criminal judicial system.

First of all, let's turn to the Criminal Code of Canada for a look at what exactly we're talking about when we bring up murder.

>Homicide
>
>222\. (1) A person commits homicide when, directly or indirectly, by any means, he causes the death of a human being.
>
>Kinds of homicide
>
>(2) Homicide is culpable or not culpable.
>
>Non culpable homicide
>
>(3) Homicide that is not culpable is not an offence.
>
>Culpable homicide
>
>(4) Culpable homicide is murder or manslaughter or infanticide.

When an individual causes someone's death we classify it as being either culpable homicide or non-culpable homicide. Non-culpable homicide means no offence has been committed, and so this would not be something under the purview of the criminal law. Culpable homicide is a different story however, as that means we need to consider whether the action falls under murder, manslaughter, or infanticide (the later of which refers to instances of the killing of a baby, which isn't an issue here, so we won't be discussing).

Culpable homicide is murder if the accused has an intent to kill. Manslaughter exists where a culpable homicide has occurred but murder would not apply. It comes down to a difference in intent. Murder is a specific intent offence, the prosecution needs to show that the accused intended the consequences of his/her actions, and in the case of murder, a killing, that the accused had the intent to kill at the time of the offence. Triers-of-fact can rely to a degree on the inference that a person usually knows the natural consequences of their actions, and means to bring them about. Manslaughter on the other hand is a general intent offence, all that needs to be proven is that the accused intended to perform the act, intention as to the consequences is not an essential element of the offence.

Of course police sometimes do have to shoot and kill suspects. It's an unfortunate reality. The law does provide protection for officers in those situations. Once again from the Criminal Code:

>Protection of persons acting under authority
>
>25\. (1) Every one who is required or authorized by law to do anything in the administration or enforcement of the law
>
>>(a) as a private person,
>>
>>(b) as a peace officer or public officer,
>>
>>(c) in aid of a peace officer or public officer, or
>>
>>(d) by virtue of his office,
>
>**is, if he acts on reasonable grounds, justified in doing what he is required or authorized to do and in using as much force as is necessary for that purpose.** [Emphasis added]
>
>[...]
>
>When not protected
>
>(3) Subject to subsections (4) and (5), a person is not justified for the purposes of subsection (1) in using force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm unless the person believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of any one under that personâ€™s protection from death or grievous bodily harm.
>
>When protected
>
>(4) A peace officer, and every person lawfully assisting the peace officer, is justified in using force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm to a person to be arrested, if
>
>>(a) the peace officer is proceeding lawfully to arrest, with or without warrant, the person to be arrested;
>>
>>(b) the offence for which the person is to be arrested is one for which that person may be arrested without warrant;
>>
>>(c) the person to be arrested takes flight to avoid arrest;
>>
>>(d) the peace officer or other person using the force believes on reasonable grounds that the force is necessary for the purpose of protecting the peace officer, the person lawfully assisting the peace officer or any other person from imminent or future death or grievous bodily harm; and
>>
>>(e) the flight cannot be prevented by reasonable means in a less violent manner.

In most parts of Canada there is a clear separation between the decision to lay charges and the decision to pursue a conviction. The decision to lay charges is up to the police in most jurisdictions (although not all), and it is their duty to do so where they have reasonable grounds to believe that an offence has been committed. The Crown has the prosecutorial discretion to continue with the matter if they deem it appropriate to do so, which is where the reasonable prospect of obtaining a conviction test comes into play. Certainly in cases such as this I would imagine that the Crown consulted closely with the SIU prior to the charge being laid, but the decision to lay charges ultimately rested with the SIU.

Constable Forcillo fired nine shots at Mr. Yatim from close range. If that doesn't show intent to kill then I have trouble figuring out what, short of actual utterances, does. If the SIU believed that Constable Forcillo's actions appropriately fell under the protection of s. 25 then no charges would have resulted. However, if they did not believe that Constable Forcillo actions could be protected pursuant to s. 25 then I would argue that they were duty bound to lay the second degree murder charge.

Of course this is not a situation where the prosecution necessarily has to go big or go home. Manslaughter is an included offence under murder, so the trier of fact could certainly find the officer not-guilty of second degree murder, but guilty of manslaughter. In that case it would come down to what intention the trier-of-fact determines is present.

In any case, one thing that I believe all can agree on is that this entire incident is a complete tragedy. It's now time to sit back and let the judicial system work its way through the process, and see how things turn out.
